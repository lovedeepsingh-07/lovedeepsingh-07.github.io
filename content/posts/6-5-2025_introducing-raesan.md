# My Struggle—and a Simple Solution

A few months ago, I was in the same spot you are: staring down exams and feeling overwhelmed. My senior friend told me, _“Just do some tests”_. Good advice—if you can actually make or access enough questions. After trying to cobble together my own quizzes and hitting paywalls and restrictions on every popular app for just a few tests, I realized there had to be a better way. So I built one.

# Welcome to Raesan: Your Personal Prep Companion

[Raesan](https://raesan.pages.dev/) isn’t a flashy, limited-trial tool—it’s a lightweight web app made by a student who’s been exactly where you are. Think of it as the teacher you never had, ready whenever you are:

- **Choose your exam**: JEE Main, NEET or JEE Advanced—pick what you’re working on today.

- **Customize your test**: Up to 50 questions in one go, so you can breeze through a quick 10-question warmup or tackle a full 50-question mock.

- **Mix question types**: Single-correct MCQs and numericals, all in one place—no switching between apps.

Everything is completely free, with no caps on how many tests you can generate. Raesan stays out of your way so you can focus on what matters: practicing.

# Built on Open Source—and Growing with You

I didn’t just slap a UI on a private database. I built Raesan as a thin, blazing-fast wrapper around an [open-source question registry](https://github.com/raesan-project/registry):

- **You get the data**: Clone the registry, turn it into your own SQLite file, run it anywhere, you can even use it in your own app or website if you want.

- **You keep it accurate**: Spot an error or outdated chapter? Submit a pull request and fix it for everyone.

- **You drive the updates**: As the syllabus changes, you and other students can push in new questions and chapters.

- **You can code with us**: If you’re into Rust, or just love clean code, dive into the registry codebase — contributions, feature requests and pull-requests are more than welcome.

This is test-prep built with the community, not for a corporation’s bottom line.

# Jump In—No Account Needed
